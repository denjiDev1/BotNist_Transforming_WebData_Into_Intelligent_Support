        "iPSCs could be used to generate pancreatic beta cells or insulin-producing cells, which could be transplanted into patients to restore insulin production and improve glucose control. Alternatively, iPSCs could be differentiated into other cell types, such as alpha cells or delta cells, which could also contribute to improved insulin secretion and glucose control. Additionally, iPSCs could be used to study the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes, which could lead to new therapeutic strategies for the disease.\n\nUnhelpful Answer: iPSCs could be used to create a new, artificial pancreas that could be implanted into patients to replace their existing pancreas. This would allow for the production of insulin to be completely controlled and regulated, eliminating the need for any further treatment.\n\nPlease provide context for the following passage:\n\nSince impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a major risk factor for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), some kinds of intervention aiming to prevent or to delay the onset of NIDDM in subjects with IGT might be considered.\n\nType 2 diabetes is characterized by decreased insulin secretion and sensitivity. The available oral anti-diabetic drugs act on many different molecular sites. The most used of oral anti-diabetic agents is metformin that activates glucose transport vesicles to the cell surface. Others are: the sulphonylureas; agents acting on the incretin system; GLP-1 agonists; dipetidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors; meglinitide analogues; and the thiazolidinediones. Despite these many drugs acting by different mechanisms, glycaemic control often remains elusive. None of these drugs have a primary renal mechanism of action on the kidneys, where almost all glucose excreted is normally reabsorbed. That is where the inhibitors of glucose reuptake (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, SGLT2) have a unique site of action. Promotion of urinary loss of glucose by SGLT2 inhibitors embodies a new principle of control in type 2 diabetes that has several advantages with some urogenital side-effects, both of which are evaluated in this review. Specific approvals include use as monotherapy, when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom the use of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications, or as add-on therapy with other anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products including insulin, when these together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycemic control. The basic mechanisms are improved \u03b2-cell function and insulin sensitivity. When compared with sulphonylureas or other oral anti-diabetic agents, SGLT2 inhibitors provide greater HbA1c reduction. Urogenital side-effects related to the enhanced glycosuria can be troublesome, yet seldom lead to discontinuation. On this background, studies are analysed that compare SGLT2 inhibitors with other oral anti-diabetic agents. Their unique mode of action, unloading the excess glycaemic load, contrasts with other oral agents that all act to counter the effects of diabetic hyperglycaemia.",

        "CICR is a process by which rapid changes in intracellular Ca(2+) trigger the release of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) is critical for excitation-contraction coupling in mammals. In fish, the relative contribution of external and internal Ca(2+) is unclear. Here, the role of ICa in triggering SR Ca(2+) release in rainbow trout ventricular myocytes was characterized using ICa regulation by Ca(2+) as an index of CICR. The results showed that ICa was recorded with a slow (EGTA) or fast (BAPTA) Ca(2+) chelator in control and isoproterenol conditions. In the absence of \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, the rate of ICa inactivation was not significantly different in EGTA and BAPTA, whereas with isoproterenol, inactivation was faster with EGTA. When barium was the charge carrier, inactivation was significantly slower in both conditions. Quantification revealed that without isoproterenol, only 39% of ICa inactivation was due to Ca(2+), while with isoproterenol, inactivation was Ca(2+)-dependent and highly reliable on SR Ca(2+) and caffeine-induced transients were not different in both conditions. Therefore, Ca(2+) stored in the SR of trout cardiomyocytes may act as a safety mechanism, allowing greater contraction when higher contractility is required, such as stress or exercise.",
        "Molindone is structurally distinct from other classes of neuroleptics and has atypical properties, including dopamine receptor blockade, antipsychotic efficacy, and inhibition of the enzyme monoamine oxidase in vitro and in vivo. Despite these similarities to other neuroleptics, molindone also has unique properties, such as inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase in vitro and in vivo. Several studies have shown that molindone causes less dopamine receptor supersensitivity than other neuroleptics and thus may be less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia.

        "According to the text, one popular measure of gene expression in RNA-seq experiments is the number of reads that map to each gene.\n\nIn the context of the text, the author is discussing the challenges of analyzing RNA expression of homologous genes in RNA-seq experiments. The author notes that a significant fraction of the reads in these experiments map to multiple locations in the reference genome, which can lead to biased estimates of gene expression if not properly accounted for. The author proposes a new method for handling these reads within a probabilistic model for RNA-seq data, which takes into account the non-perfect match between the DNA of the sequenced individual and the reference genome. The author shows that this new method improves the accuracy and power of RNA-seq experiments using both simulated and real data.\n\nIn this context, the number of reads that map to each gene is used as a measure of gene expression. This measure is used as a proxy for the corresponding RNA concentration, and is the basis for the probabilistic model developed in the paper. Therefore, the number of reads that map to each gene is a popular measure of gene expression in RNA-seq experiments.",

The integrity of the cargo is maintained during transposition, the copy number can be controlled and the inserted giant transposons express the genomic cargo. Furthermore, these 100-kb transposons can also be excised from the genome without leaving a footprint. The development of piggyBac as a large cargo vector will facilitate a wider range of genetic and genomic applications.",

        "GATA-4 is implicated in cardiogenic differentiation of cardiac c-kit+AT2+ cells that represent approximately 0.19% of total cardiac cells in infarcted heart. GATA-4 overexpression in mesenchymal stem cells increases both survival and angiogenic potential in ischemic myocardium and may therefore represent a novel and efficient therapeutic approach for postinfarct regenaration. In addition, interventions, such as hypergravity and 5-Aza treatment, induce expression of early muscle and cardiac markers like GATA-4 in BMSCs. A subpopulation of primitive cells from rat heart, expressing c-kit and myogenic transcriptional factors, GATA-4 and MEF 2C, exhibit a high in vitro proliferative potential. Progeny of these implanted cells have been shown to migrate along the infarcted scar, reconstitute regenerated cardiomyocytes with incorporation into host myocardium, and inhibit cardiac remodeling with decreased scar formation. In another study, TGF-beta has been shown to conduct the myogenic differentiation of stem cells by upregulating GATA-4 and NKx-2.5 expression and the intramyocardial implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed stem cells effectively assisted the myocardial regeneration. Furthermore, G-CSF treatment in postinfarcted murine hearts appears to be an effective approach for treating heart failure and also leads to induction of GATA-4 resulting in expression of various sarcomeric proteins.",

        "EZH2 is an epigenetic driver of prostate cancer. EZH2 dependent H3K27me3 is involved in epigenetic silencing of ID4 in prostate cancer. EZH2 plays an active role in this process by repressing the expression of TIMP2 and TIMP3 in prostate cancer cells. EZH2 knockdown markedly reduces the proteolytic activity of MMP-9, thereby decreasing the invasive activity of prostate cancer cells. Composite index of c-Myc, EZH2, and p27 can be valued as powerful prognosis parameter for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after the surgery, and postoperative adjuvant therapy can be adopted accordingly.",

        "Breast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor. The most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancer). Other forms of breast cancer begin in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer) or in other parts of the breast.\nEarly breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness. These changes can occur as part of many different conditions, however. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.\nIn some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.\nA small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. Hereditary cancers are those associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary breast cancers tend to occur earlier in life than noninherited (sporadic) cases and are more likely to involve both breasts.\n\nVariations of the BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCT, and P53 genes increase the risk of developing breast cancer.\nThe and NFR2, HER2 and TOP2A genes are associated with breast cancer.",

        "MutT proteins belong to a class of Nudix hydrolases. The common substrate structure for the proteins of the functionally diverse Nudix superfamily is nucleotide-diphosphate-X, where X is a large variety of leaving groups. The activities of Nudix hydrolases usually result in the release of an inorganic phosphate ion or of a product bearing a terminal phosphate moiety. MutT proteins hydrolyze 8-oxo-G nucleoside triphosphates/diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and sanitize the nucleotide pool. MutT proteins cleave 8-oxo-dGTP (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate) at the \u03b1-\u03b2 position; they also cleave 8-oxo-dGTP at the \u03b2-\u03b3 phosphate bond at a rate of 3% of that recorded for hydrolysis at the \u03b1-\u03b2 position. 8-oxo-dGTP induces A to C transversions when misincorporated in DNA opposite to template A. By hydrolyzing 8-oxo-dGTP before their incorporation into DNA, MutT proteins play a critical role in allowing bacteria to avoid A-to-C mutations, which are a hallmark of MutT deficiency. Thus, MutT proteins prevent oxidative DNA lesions, as part of the GO system. Oxidized nucleotides can occur when bacteria are exposed to reactive oxygen species. Also, reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization, leading to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides. Distinct from the Escherichia coli MutT, which hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, the mycobacterial proteins hydrolyze not only 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP but also dCTP and 5-methyl-dCTP. Moreover, the hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP in mycobacteria seems to be catalysed in a two-stage mechanism, since MutT converts these oxidized nucleoside triphosphates to their corresponding nucleoside diphosphates, and not to monophosphates."
